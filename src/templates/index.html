                    Another World Cup, another occasion to pit cloudreacher against
                    cloudreacher for the title of the ultimate football clairvoyant!
                    Think that person is you? If so, join us in the Cloudreach
                    World Cup 2018 predictions game!

                <p class="text-margin-top">The game will run two concurrent competitions:</p>

                <h4 class="text-margin-top">The sweepstake competition</h4>
                <p>
                    No skills are involved here. Each participant will be
                    allocated one of the 32 countries in the tournament. You win if
                    your team wins the tournament! However, there's a twist... As we
                    will likely have more than 32 people participate, you
                    might have to share the glory of winning with other people. The game
                    will ensure all teams have been allocated at least once before
                    making them available again for a further round of allocations.
